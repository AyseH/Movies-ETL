# Movies-ETL
Working on ETL-Module 8

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Amazing Prime with a clean dataset of the movies data from Wikipedia and MovieLens for the hackathon it is sponsoring. The data is extracted from these web sources, transformed into a clean single dataset and loaded into a SQL database. A function is created that takes in these data from different sources, performs the ETL process and adds it to PostgresSQL database.
